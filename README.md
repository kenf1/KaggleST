## KaggleST-R

My code for the Kaggle Spaceship Titanic competition.



### Next steps:

- convert duplicated code into functions/loops
- more in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - I focused on the missingness but 
- imputation (filling in missing values)
  - use more iterations (currently set to 1)
  - Cabin variable: a [user](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/discussion/322945) noted that while they are missing at random, a more simplier/better way of filling in these missing values is by looking for missing Cabin numbers in-between
